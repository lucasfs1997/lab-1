Golf App

	I want to design an app for golfers that aims at aiding them help predict their score and focus upon what to work on. The app would allow golfers to put in
a hole on a golf course, with relative shape and distance, and compare this with other similar scores. As time went on, it would be able to carefully predict
scores on every type of hole. This would tell you what your weakest holes are and where to practice. Not only this, but it could also serve to have an instructional
function. It would pull off basic drills, practices, and stretches to do before each round and in general to improve your game. It could also serve to assist instructors
by helping give their students drills to practice. In order to do this, I would have users use a graphical interface to build a hole, following basic views. From there,
the users would input their scores and handicaps. From here, based off each type of hole, it would allow users to see their average score, telling them that they
should either try a new strategy or continue with their current one.
