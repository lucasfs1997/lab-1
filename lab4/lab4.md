Why you should choose a license:

  In the case of free software, it allows you to protect the four essential freedoms. The licenses that protect your software
allow your user base to use it in any way they wish and modify it how they please. A license protects this and makes sure
no one can remove these freedoms.

Why you should not work on a project without a license:

  If a project lacks a license then the original owners could change the product at any time from free to non-free. Sailfish OS
is an example of this, where after they had obtained the groundwork they placed a EULA license on it. A project without a license
is unprotected and can lead to you losing your work.

Apache vs GPL vs LGPL:

  For a developer and the common good, the best license is the GPL or LGPL, depending upon what is being worked upon.
These licenses provide the software with the most freedom, allowing any and all files inside of said project to be changed. 
The only requirement, is that changes must be logged. This software can be used in any way, shape, or form the developer desires,
providing complete freedom. However, an Apache license would be best for a company. It allows the company sub-licensing 
abilities, which means that the software can be passed along without the original licensing, providing new licensing powers 
to specific people. However, the biggest change is that certain material must be preserved. This allows protection for specific 
parts of a project for a company.

Do I agree with this claim Gopher:
	Given the information presented, I do agree with this claim. Part of a project being open source is that it must be open to the
large hacking community, so that developers are allowed to make their own decisions on a tool they may use. Gopher not only 
failed to do this, but continued to hide their intentions, which would have made many distrustful.
